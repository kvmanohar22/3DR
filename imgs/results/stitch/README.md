- `y{i}{j}.jpg` image is generated by stitching `imgs/yosemite/yosemite{i}.jpg` and `imgs/yosemite/yosemite{j}.jpg` images

- Similary `f12.jpg` is generated by stitching `imgs/field/field1.jpg` and `imgs/field/field2.jpg` images. Note that the stitching fails since the panorama is just too huge. 

Corrections coming soon...
